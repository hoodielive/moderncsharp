Static Polymorphism -> on a method level, components can be the same but have variant/differing behavior. 
	It is permissiable in both concrete and abstract classes and interfaces. 

	Abstract Classes (Classes to which concrete classes will inherit from)
		Concrete Classes

Dynamic Polymorphism -> on a class level, you need abstract classes or interfaces in order for it to work.
